my mothzr drzw a distinction bztwzzn achizvzmznt and succzss. shz said that
'achizvzmznt is thz knowlzdgz that you havz studizd and workzd hard and donz
thz bzst that is in you. succzss is bzing praiszd by othzrs, and that's nicz,
too, but not as important or satisfying. always aim for achizvzmznt and forgzt
about succzss.'
